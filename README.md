# Correlation-of-COVID19-XRay-images-to-mortality_rate
We have established a CNN model in a labelled dataset of COVID-19 infected patients. The dataset comprised of a mortality label with chest X-ray images. A GAN network is additionally constructed to generative more training data, and hence to increase the accuracy of our model.
